        <p style="font-size: larger;">I am a person who is goal driven and spirit led. God has always been a factor in my life from since I was young, my religion has been something that has brought me comfort in times of trouble and I have used it as an anchor in my daily life, that’s where I think my love for people came. During my fellowship at church and experiences that with others is where God brought me toy true passion which is helping others. People have always been a factor in my life, and they have given me the courage to do all that I thought was impossible, from my sisters to my parents, even my closest friends, they have always encouraged me to seek greater for myself. So now I am more determined to achieve more for myself than ever and push till I have achieved all my goals.

        <p style="font-size: x-large;">I am independent person who loves the idea of a challenge, often when a challenge arises I am normally the first person with a solution. I love working as a team where most of the time I like to take charge however I have a great ear for listen to other people’s views and perspective on any project that we might be doing. I am good at public speaking also, I have improved my communication skills (which I have found come in handy when it comes to conflict resolution).All in all I am a person who when put to the test shows of how capable I am.
